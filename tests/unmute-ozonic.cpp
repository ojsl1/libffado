 * "unmute-ozonic" by Mark Brand (orania), based on "test-enhanced-mixer" by Daniel Wagner
 * This is a knee-jerk reaction to the pathetic situation of requiring a dual-boot setup
 * for the sole and only purpose of unmuting the outputs of my M-Audio Ozonic.  Seriously!? ;)
 *
 * This utility requires patches to avc_function_block.cpp and bebob_function_block.cpp
 * which might be problematic for other devices?  I've included my patch to tests/SConscript.
 *
 * Also had a preliminary go at the mixer, which seems to work... but is incomplete.
 * All were originally based on revision 1957, though everything works for me under 1985.
