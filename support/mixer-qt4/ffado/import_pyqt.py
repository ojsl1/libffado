# This module handles the importing of PyQt modules for both PyQt4 and PyQt5
# under Python2 or Python3.  If Python3 is installed it is assumed that
# PyQt5 is in use (this is reasonable because PyQt5 is what everyone wants
# to use under Python3).  Otherwise (that is, under Python2), an import of
# PyQt4 is tried first; if an import error occurs then PyQt5 is assumed.
#
# All modules used by any part of ffado-mixer are imported.  This greatly
# simplifies the process.  Otherwise the modules to import would be delivered
# by string variables, and there isn't a supported way to do this across 
# Python2 and Python3.
