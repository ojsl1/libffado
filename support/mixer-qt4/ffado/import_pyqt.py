ffado_pyqt_version = 4

# This module handles the importing of PyQt modules for both PyQt4 and PyQt5.
# The idea is to first try importing PyQt4.  If there's an import error it's
# assumed PyQt5 is present instead and that is tried.
#
# All modules used by any part of ffado-mixer are imported.  This greatly
# simplifies the process.  Otherwise the modules to import would be delivered
# by string variables, and there isn't a supported way to do this across 
# Python2 and Python3.
